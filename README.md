# GuziecYAIC
**GuziecYAIC - Yet Another Internet Communicator** made by part of team GuziecCo.

**GuziecYAIC is simple TCP socket communicator** which allows to open multiple connection (temporarily set up to 8 connections).
This application uses WPF and .Net Framework 4.6.1 (it's highly probable that it can be lowered to .Net Framework 4 or 4.5, but I didn't test it).
I know that this communicator isn't optimally programmed (thanks to our professor). This is caused by *must have* property ("highly visible thread creation").
